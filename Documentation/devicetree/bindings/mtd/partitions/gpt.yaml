title: GUID Partition Table (GPT)

description: The GPT format is commonly used on block devices to describe a
partitioning scheme. It mainly consists of a Legacy or Protective MBR for
backwards compatibility, a primary GPT header with an array of Partition Table
Entries, and a backup header with a backup array of PTEs. This partition table
format can be used on MTD devices, specifically NOR flash devices, since NAND
flashes are susceptible to bad blocks which could easily corrupt the GPT layout.
Logical Block Addresses (LBAs) are defined to target 512-byte blocks.
